# React Pomodoro App

**<p>In this project, I made a pomodoro (25 + 5 O'Clock) application with React. If you want to manage your time while studying or doing your work, you can use this application. After starting the 25-minute timer, it warns you by playing a beep sound when the timer ends. After a 5-minute break, it will beep you again. It warns you and a new session (25 minutes) starts. If these times seem short or long to you, you can increase or decrease these times.</p>**
